> "Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) service by Amazon Web Services (AWS) since 2010. The name is a possible reference to U.S. Routes, and "53" is a reference to the TCP/UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed. Route 53 allows users to reach AWS services and non-AWS infrastructure and to monitor the health of their application and its endpoints."
