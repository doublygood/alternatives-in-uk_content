> "LastPass is a password manager application. The standard version of LastPass comes with a web interface, but also includes plugins for various web browsers and apps for many smartphones. It also includes support for bookmarklets.

Founded in 2008 by four developers, Lastpass was acquired by GoTo (formerly LogMeIn Inc.) for $110 million in 2015. LastPass was spun-off from GoTo into a stand-alone business in 2024."
